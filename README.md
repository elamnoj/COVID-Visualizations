# COVID-Visualizations

COVID 19 has spread rapidly throughout the United States.
As of this project (4/15/20) around 4 million tests had been conducted with 600,000 confirmed cases.

This kernel explores mapping time-series data from John Hopkins into a geosptial framework to visualize the progression of the disease.
The data ranges from March 16, 2020 - April 15,2020 and renders every date in the range into an individual map.
The maps were then consolidated and made into a gif also listed in the repository. 
This example can be embedded into websites or used in presentations. 

The application of this project is not only cosmetic, but can allow for a simple visual to understand where some states may be in their respective curve. 

Future projects may include an interactive mapping option via maply or exapnding the data set after the cases steadily decrese.
